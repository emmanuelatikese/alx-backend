### Pagination
Pagination is a technique used to divide a large set of data into smaller, more manageable chunks, or "pages". This is particularly useful for improving the performance and user experience of applications that need to display extensive lists or datasets. By loading and displaying data in smaller segments, pagination reduces load times and enhances navigation. Implementing pagination typically involves:

* Data Query: Fetching a specific subset of data from a database.
* Page Navigation: Providing controls for users to navigate between different pages (e.g., next, previous, first, and last).
* Page Size: Defining the number of items to display on each page.
