#### Working on Caching in python
### Cache Documentation
## Overview
A cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than by accessing the primary storage location. Caches are used to reduce the latency of data access, improve the speed of data retrieval, and decrease the load on the underlying data storage.

## Benefits
* Performance: Speeds up data retrieval by storing frequently accessed data closer to the application.
* Scalability: Reduces the load on the primary data store, allowing it to handle more concurrent requests.
* Cost Efficiency: Lowers the cost of data retrieval by reducing the need for expensive data operations.
